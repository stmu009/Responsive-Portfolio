                        <p>Luke! Luke! Luke! Hey! Hey! I knew you'd come back! I just knew it! Well, I wasn't gonna let you
                            get all the credit and take all the reward. Hey, I knew there was more to you than money. Oh,
                            no! Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you? We'll get to
                            work on him right away. You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll
                            gladly donate them. He'll be all right.</p>
                        <p>Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our
                            only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio!
                            Yes sir? We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I
                            didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems
                            to be the only way in or out, all other information on your level is restricted.</p>
                        <p>There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the
                            droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing
                            here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos
                            Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.
                            How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want
                            them. </p>
                        <p>You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were...
                            We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here.
                            It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2
                            unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel
                            base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.</p>
                        <p>This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. I don't like the look of
                            this. Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for
                            passage to the Alderaan system. Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard
                            of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than
                            twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking
                            about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? Only
                            passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. What is it? Some kind of local
                            trouble? Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.</p>
